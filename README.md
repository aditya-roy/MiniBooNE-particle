# MiniBooNE-particle
used to distinguish electron neutrinos (signal) from muon neutrinos (background)
Data Set Information:

The submitted file is set up as follows. In the first line is the the number of signal events followed by the number of background events. The signal events come first, followed by the background events. Each line, after the first line has the 50 particle ID variables for one event.

Attribute Information:

50 particle ID variables (real) for each event.
